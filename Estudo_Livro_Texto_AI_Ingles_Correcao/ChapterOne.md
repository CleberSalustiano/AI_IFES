# Chapter One

- AI is one of the newest fields in science and engineering.
- AI is relevant to any intellectual task.

## What is AI

AI can be defined by four dimensions, where it's defined 
by reasoning and behavior (comportamento).

### Acting Humanly
- A way to test this dimension is through the Turing Test. 
It was designed to provide a satisfactory operational 
definition of intelligence.
- An AI passes the test when, after a human interrogator 
poses written questions and cannot distinguish whether 
the answers were generated by a human or a machine, it 
utilizes responses generated based on questions rather 
than those created by a human.
- The computer would need some capabilities: natural 
- language processing, knowledge representation, 
automated reasoning, and machine learning.
- Also exists the **total Turing Test** that includes a 
video signal so that the interrogator can test the 
subject's perceptual abilities, as well as the opportunity 
for the interrogator to pass physical objects "through 
the hatch."
- For the total Turing test, the computer would also 
need computer vision and robotics.
- These six disciplines compose most of AI, and it's possible
 because of the Turing Test, which remains relevant 60 years
 later.

### Thinking Humanly
- These try to approximate the human-to-machine connection
 rationally, and it's possible in three ways: through 
 introspection, psychological experiments, and brain imaging.
- Cognitive Science is very important for this AI area, and 
it shows the differences and similarities between AI 
techniques and human cognition.

### Thinking Rationally
- The "laws of thought" approach.
- The idea is to use **Logic** to make correct thoughts.
- The Logicist tradition within AI hopes to build intelligent
systems on such programs.
- There are some problems with this line of thought, like
transforming informal sentences into formal sentences used 
in logic statements.

### Acting Rationally
- It's the most commonly used approach, mainly in textbooks.
- The idea of agents is the possibility to perceive the 
environment, persist over a prolonged time period, adapt 
to change, and create and pursue goals.
- This approach can follow the "laws of thought" approach, 
but it's not the only way. It can make decisions using 
other strategies when there isn't a perfect logical scenario.
- In general, this approach has two advantages over others. 
First, it's more morally general than the "laws of thought" 
approach, and second, it's more amenable to scientific 
development than other approaches.

## The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

In this topic, the textbook provides a brief history of the 
main disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and 
techniques to AI.

### Philosophy
- Philosophy has an important place in AI knowledge. It started 
with the conception of the first calculator and continued with 
calculators that could add, subtract, multiply, and take roots.
- Evolution involved the observation of animal behavior and how 
arithmetical machines produced effects that appeared closer to 
thought than all the actions of animals.
- Another discussion is about the difference between matter and 
mind.
- Before thinking about a physical mind, there was the problem 
of establishing the source of knowledge, and before concepts 
like empiricism and thought-line philosophy, there was the 
first theory of mind as a computational process.
- Lastly, philosophy helped AI distinguish between knowledge 
and action. Many philosophical discussions can be used in AI to 
create good AIs.

### Mathematics
- Along with philosophy, mathematics helped apply philosophical 
ideas. New mathematical areas were created and helped AI, 
including logic, computation, and probability.
- The first step was **logic**, when Boole introduced 
first-order logic, which is still used today.
- After logic, **algorithms** made it possible to formalize 
general mathematical reasoning as logical deduction.
- Alan Turing helped show how functions are **computable**, and 
after that, tractability became another focus.
- Another important area is **probability**, which can predict 
future actions.

### Economics
- Probability had more specific studies in economics and 
contributed to creating other knowledge areas.
- Decision theory and game theory are some of the new areas 
where economics made contributions to AI.

### Neuroscience
- Some important questions are "How do brains process 
information?" The study of the brain is an important point in 
creating AI with human-like personality.

### Psychology
- Points like human behavior and how to replicate something 
similar in AI.
- Another point is cognitive psychology and how a brain 
resembles an information-processing device.
- Therefore, with this knowledge, scientists made the 
conclusion that "a cognitive theory should be like a computer 
program."

### Computer Engineering
- How can we build an efficient computer?
- Since WWII to now, computers have become more powerful.

### Control Theory and Cybernetics
- How can artifacts operate under their control?

### Linguistics
- How does language relate to thought?

## The History of Artificial Intelligence

### The Gestation of Artificial Intelligence (1943–1955)
- It began with the idea of simulating neurons, trying to 
replicate a brain.
- In 1950, two Harvard students created the first neural 
network computer that simulated 40 neurons.
- The most important figure during this period was Turing, with 
the Turing Test, theorems, and the Child Theorem idea, which 
aimed not to create an adult AI but to create a child AI.

### The Birth of Artificial Intelligence (1956)
- The two-month workshop at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956 
brought together 10 researchers to create machines that could 
use languages, form abstractions and concepts, solve 
human-reserved problems, and study artificial intelligence.
- This workshop didn't lead to any new breakthroughs, but it 
introduced all the major figures to each other and created a 
knowledge area.

### Early Enthusiasm, Great Expectations (1952–1969)
- Enthusiasm for creating AIs was born. Initially, some AI 
programs were created, and in 1956, the first AI that could 
play a game and quickly learn to play better than its creator 
was showcased.
- This movement created a strong impression, and researchers 
believed that everything would be possible. Although in 1958, 
McCarthy believed it was possible to create a complete AI that 
thinks completely like a human and learns about new knowledge 
without being reprogrammed.

### A Dose of Reality (1966–1973)
- The AIs created initially had good results only when tested 
with select data. However, they failed miserably when faced 
with wider selections of problems.
- Expectations were that things could be achieved within 10 
years, but in reality, it took 40 years.
- The first problem was the lack of background knowledge for 
the AI to understand.
- Another problem was that in microworlds, the possibilities 
were limited, and trying different combinations of steps until 
a solution was found was possible. However, this methodology 
failed in the real world because trying multiple steps in the 
real world was only possible for powerful computers. 
Additionally, "The fact that a program can find a solution in 
principle does not mean that the program contains any of the 
mechanisms needed to find it in practice."

### Knowledge-Based Systems: The Key to Power? (1969–1979)
- The new approach called "weak methods" provided a new 
perspective on the AI field because researchers understood that 
solving hard problems required knowledge about the problem and 
possibly solving specific parts of it.
- The DENDRAL program was the first system with this vision and 
successfully solved a specific chemistry problem. This was 
possible because "All the relevant theoretical knowledge to 
solve these problems has been mapped over from its general form 
into efficient special forms."
- After this successful case, other solutions adopted this 
perception, such as MYCIN and SHRDLU.

### AI Becomes an Industry (1980–Present)
- The first successful commercial expert systems helped 
enterprises save millions of dollars, and the general public 
became more acquainted with this field.

### The Return of Neural Networks (1986–Present)
- With more people studying this field, new concepts like 
**back-propagation** and **connectionist** theories were 
created, helping to understand new ways to use neural networks 
and find solutions.

### AI Adopts the Scientific Method (1987–Present)
- AI distanced itself from computer science and adopted the 
scientific method based on existing concepts in computer 
science.

### The Emergence of Intelligent Agents (1995–Present)
- Creating intelligent agents is challenging because sensors 
aren't advanced enough to capture information from the 
environment. However, intelligent agents are crucial for 
expanding the horizons of AI thought.

### The Availability of Very Large Data Sets (2001–Present)
- For 60 years, AI research focused on algorithms, but recent 
work suggests that, for many problems, focusing on data and 
being less selective about which algorithm to apply may be more 
effective.
- Thus, it's observed that a mediocre algorithm with a very 
large dataset can be more accurate than the best-known 
algorithm with a small dataset.

## The State of the Art
- In the State of the Art, many fields and studies have been 
created, including **Robotic Vehicles**, **Speech 
Recognition**, **Autonomous Planning and Scheduling**, **Game 
Playing**, **Spam Fighting**, **Logistics Planning**, and 
others.
