# Chapter One

- AI is one of the newest fileds in science and engineering. 
- AI is relevant to any intellectual task.

## What is AI

Ai can be define by Four dimension where it's define by reasoning x behavior (comportamento).

### Thinking Humanly
  - Some form to test this dimension is by Turing Test, 
  it was designed to provide a satisfactory 
  operatiuonal definition of intelligence.
  - An AI passes the test when, after a human interrogator 
  poses written questions and cannot distinguish whether the 
  answers were generated by a human or a machine, 
  it utilizes responses generated based on questions 
  rather than those created by a human.
  - The computer would need some capabilities: 
  natual language processing, knowledge representation,
  automated reasoning and machine learning. 
  - Also exist the **total Turing Test** than includes a video signal 
  so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abitiles,
  as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass 
  physical objects "through the hatch".
  - For the total Turing test the computer also would need: 
  computer vision and robotics. 
  - These six disciplines compose most of AI is possible because 
  the Turing Test that remains relevant 60 years later.
