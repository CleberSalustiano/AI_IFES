# Chapter One

- AI is one of the newest fileds in science and engineering. 
- AI is relevant to any intellectual task.

## What is AI

Ai can be define by Four dimension where it's define by reasoning x behavior (comportamento).

### Acting Humanly 
  - Some form to test this dimension is by Turing Test, 
  it was designed to provide a satisfactory 
  operatiuonal definition of intelligence.
  - An AI passes the test when, after a human interrogator 
  poses written questions and cannot distinguish whether the 
  answers were generated by a human or a machine, 
  it utilizes responses generated based on questions 
  rather than those created by a human.
  - The computer would need some capabilities: 
  natual language processing, knowledge representation,
  automated reasoning and machine learning. 
  - Also exist the **total Turing Test** than includes a video signal 
  so that the interrogator can test the subject's perceptual abitiles,
  as well as the opportunity for the interrogator to pass 
  physical objects "through the hatch".
  - For the total Turing test the computer also would need: 
  computer vision and robotics. 
  - These six disciplines compose most of AI is possible because 
  the Turing Test that remains relevant 60 years later.

### Thinking Humanly
  - These try to aproximate the human to machine by rationally, 
  and it's possible by three ways: through introspection, 
  thought psychological experiments and through brain imaging.
  - The Cognitive Science is very important for this AI area
  and it show the differences and similarities between AI
  techniquess and human cognition.

### Thinking Rationally 
  - The "laws of thought" approach
  - The idea is use the **Logic** for made correctly thoughts
  - Logicist tradition within AI hopes to build on such 
  programs to create intelligent systems.  
  - Exist some problem for this thought line, like the 
  tranformation the informal sentences for formal sentences
  Then's used in logic sentences.

### Acting Rationally
  - It's the most used approach, and the mainly in textbook.
  - The idea of agents is the possibily to perceive the 
  environment, persist over a prolonged time perioed, adapted
  to change and create and persues goals.
  - This approach can do the "laws of thought" approach, but
  it's not the only form. Can made decision using others 
  strategies when doesn't exist a perfect logic scene.  
  - In general this approach has two advantages about anothers, 
  first is moral general than "laws of thought" approach and 
  second it's more amenable to scientfic development than
  anothers approach.


## The Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

In this topic the textbook provide a brief history of the
mainly discipline that contributed ideas, viewspoints and techniques AI.

### Philosophy
  - The philosophy has an important place in AI knowledge
  this started since the first calculator conception to the
  mainly calculator created with add, subtract, multiply and 
  take roots.
  - In evolution have the observation the animal behavior and
  how the aritmetical machine produces effects which appear 
  nearer to thought than all the actons of animals.
  - Another discution is about difference between matter and mind
  - Before thought about physical mind exist the establish the 
  source of knowledge problem, and before some concepts like empiricism
  and thought line phylosophy reached the first theory of mind as
  a computational process.
  - And in the final the philosophy helped AI in disticton between 
  - knowledge and action
  - So many philosophy discutions can be used in AI for
  made good AIs.

### Mathematics
  - Along with philosophy, mathematics helped to apply the 
  philosopy ideas. New mathematics areas were created and helped
  the AI: logic, computation and probability
  - The first step was the **logic**, when Boole made the first-order logic
  that is used today
  - After the logic the **algorithm** made possible to formalize 
  general mathematical reasoning as logical deduction.
  - Therefore Alan Turing helped to show how functions are **computable**, 
  and after the tractability was the another focus.
  - And in the final another important area is the **probability**, 
  then can predict the future actions.

### Economics
  - Probability had more studies specific in economy and
  created anothers knowledge areas.
  - Decision theory and Game theory are some new ares than 
  economics made contribuition to AI.

### Neuroscience
  - Some important question is "How do brains process
  information. 
  - The brain study is an import point to create AI
  with human personality.

### Psychology
  - Some points like the human behavior and how to create
  something like that in AI
  - Another point is the Cognitive psychology and how
  a brain looks like a information-processing device.
  - Therefore with this knowledge are these scients made the
  conclusiont "a cognitive theory should be like a 
  computer program".

### Computer Engineering
  - How can we build an efficient computer?
  - Since WWII to now the computers are going to more 
  powerful.

### Control theory and cybernetics
  - How can artifacts operate under their own control?

### Linguistics
  - How does language relate to thought?

## The history of Artificial Intelligence

### The gestation of artificial intelligence (1943–1955)
 
### The birth of artificial intelligence (1956)
  
### Early enthusiasm, great expectations (1952–1969)

### A dose of reality (1966–1973)

### Knowledge-based systems: The key to power? (1969–1979)
